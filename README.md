# Neural_Network_Charity_Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 
From Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team, Beks received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. We us machine learning to use the features in the provided dataset to help Beks create a binary classifier that is capable of predicting whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

## Results from Data Processing: 

- What variable(s) are considered the target(s) for your model? IS_SUCCESSFUL column
- What variable(s) are considered to be the features for your model? All but IS_SUCCESSFUL
- What variable(s) are neither targets nor features, and should be removed from the input data? Dropped EIN, NAME becasue no additional updates were made. 

## Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model:
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why? had three ayers to be able to activate the enochs. 
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance? Yes
- What steps did you take to try and increase model performance? There were three attempts that were completed to determine items.


## Summary: 
The model with an accuracy score of 50% after optimization. The initial neural network had a accuracy score of 69%.
